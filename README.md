# Vulnerability Management using Nessus

---------

## Project Summary 
This project serves as a practical demonstration of key concepts in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle, focusing on vulnerability scanning and remediation. Leveraging Nessus Essentials, I conducted scans on local VMs hosted within the VMware Workstation. The project encompassed both non-credentialed and credentialed scans to uncover vulnerabilities. Subsequently, we implemented remediation strategies to address identified issues and validated the effectiveness of the remediation efforts through rescan.

## Key Highlights:
- Vulnerability Scanning: Utilized Nessus Essentials for in-depth scanning of local VMs.
- Vulnerability Remediation: Implemented strategies to address discovered vulnerabilities.
- Lifecycle Overview: Showcased key steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle.
- Credential-Based Scans: Demonstrated the importance of credentialed scans for thorough assessments.
- VMware Workstation Integration: Leveraged VMWare Workstation for isolated lab environments.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Vulnerability Management
- Nessus Essentials Proficiency
- VMWare Workstation Setup
- Credential-Based Scanning
- Remediation Strategies
- Validation and Verification
  
This project provides a hands-on illustration of the critical process of identifying, addressing, and verifying vulnerabilities, contributing to a proactive and secure IT environment.



## Project Steps

1. **Install VMware**

2. **Install Nessus Essentials**

3. **Install Windows 10 ISO**
   
5. **Set up VM** 
   - Installed Windows 10 
   - Configured network adapter settings (network connection) to 'bridged' to put VM on the same network as my PC.
   - Purpose: To allow Nessus Essentials to communicate with my VM more easily.

6. **Ensure VM connectivity** 
   - Ensured VM connectivity for seamless communication.
   - Opened the command prompt on the VM.
   - Obtained the VM's IPv4 address using 'ipconfig.'
   - Conducted a successful local machine ping test to verify network reachability.

7. **Perform basic non-credentialed scan against VM**
   - Name: My Windows 10 VM
   - Target: My Windows 10 VM IP address

<br>

8. **Configure VM for credential scan**
   - Enabled remote registry (this will allow the scanner to connect to the VM registry and look for insecure configurations).
   - Enabled file and printer sharing.
   - Disabled user account control settings (because my computer is not on the domain, I did a hack to be able to scan it).
   - Added key to the registry (further disables user control for the remote account I am going to use to connect to this computer during the scan).
   - Restarted VM

9. **Perform basic credentialed scan against VM**
   - Provided credentials to Nessus to rescan VM.

<br>

9. **Install deprecated software**
   - Installed deprecated software (Mozilla Firefox) on the VM to make the VM vulnerable.

11. **Relaunch credentialed scan against VM!**
    - Relaunch credentialed scan against VM with deprecated software installed
    - Review results
    - Implement Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
